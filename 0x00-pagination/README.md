# 0x00. Python - Pagination

## Description

This project focuses on implementing pagination techniques in Python. You'll learn how to efficiently handle large datasets by breaking them into manageable pages. The tasks cover basic pagination, hypermedia pagination, and deletion-resilient pagination, demonstrating different approaches to navigating through datasets.

## Requirements

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Interpreter | Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7) |
| File Endings | All files should end with a new line |
| Shebang | The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3` |
| README | A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory |
| Coding Style | pycodestyle (version 2.5.x) |
| File Length | The length of files will be tested using `wc` |
| Documentation | Modules and functions should be documented |
| Type Annotations | All functions must be type-annotated |
| Dataset | Use `Popular_Baby_Names.csv` for all tasks |

## Project Structure

| Task | Description | File |
|------|-------------|------|
| 0 | Implement a helper function for pagination range calculation | 0-simple_helper_function.py |
| 1 | Implement basic pagination on a dataset | 1-simple_pagination.py |
| 2 | Implement hypermedia pagination with additional metadata | 2-hypermedia_pagination.py |
| 3 | Implement deletion-resilient hypermedia pagination | 3-hypermedia_del_pagination.py |

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

* Understand and implement pagination algorithms in Python
* Calculate index ranges for pagination
* Handle large datasets efficiently using pagination
* Implement hypermedia pagination with navigation metadata
* Create deletion-resilient pagination systems
* Work with CSV files and datasets in Python
* Write properly documented and type-annotated code
* Implement assertion checks for parameter validation
* Handle edge cases in pagination systems
